            <p className="content">In CipherScape, you'll embark on a thrilling adventure as an explorer delving into various locations, such as ancient ruins, secret societies, and high-tech facilities.

            <p className="heading">Rooms</p>
            <p className="content">As you enter each room, you'll be presented with four possible directions: north, south, east, and west. Your intuition and exploration skills will be put to the test, as only one direction leads to the next room, while the others hold different obstacles.</p>
            <p className="heading">direction</p>
            <p className="content">In one direction, a fearsome monster awaits, ready to engage in battle. Your ability to strategically choose and use the items you've collected will determine your success in defeating the monster and unlocking the next room.</p>
            <p className="content">In another direction, you'll encounter a mind-bending puzzle that demands your problem-solving prowess. Analyze the clues, think critically, and find the correct solution to unlock the path forward. Failure to solve the puzzle will block your progress and require you to find an alternative route.</p>
            <p className="content">Some rooms may present unique challenges beyond monsters and puzzles. You might come across locked doors that require a specific key or encounter hidden traps that could inflict damage to your health. Adaptability and resourcefulness are key to overcoming these obstacles and proceeding on your journey.</p>
